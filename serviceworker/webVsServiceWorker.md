Web workers and service workers are both JavaScript-based technologies used in web development, but they serve different purposes and have distinct use cases.

Web Worker:

Context: Web workers are designed to run JavaScript code in the background, separate from the main web page's thread. They are often used for parallel processing and running tasks concurrently to prevent the main thread from becoming unresponsive.

Use Cases:

Parallel Processing: Web workers are useful for CPU-intensive tasks, such as data processing, image manipulation, and complex calculations. They allow you to offload these tasks to separate threads.
Improved Responsiveness: By running heavy tasks in web workers, you ensure that the main UI thread remains responsive, providing a better user experience.
Communication: Web workers communicate with the main thread through a messaging system, passing data back and forth using the postMessage API.

Examples:

Performing image or video processing in the background.
Handling complex mathematical computations.
Implementing real-time chat applications.
Service Worker:

Context: Service workers are a specific type of web worker that run in the background and act as a proxy between the web page and the network. They are primarily used for providing offline capabilities, caching, and push notifications in web applications.

Use Cases:

Caching: Service workers can intercept network requests and cache responses, allowing web applications to work offline or improve performance by serving cached content.
Push Notifications: Service workers enable push notifications in web applications, even when the app is not open in the browser.
Background Sync: They can handle background data synchronization, ensuring that data is updated when the network connection is available.
Communication: Service workers do not directly interact with the web page's JavaScript. They communicate through events, such as the 'fetch' event for network requests and the 'push' event for notifications.

Examples:

Making a web app available offline (Progressive Web App).
Implementing push notifications in a web app.
Background synchronization of data.

In summary, web workers are more general-purpose, used for parallel processing and keeping the main UI thread responsive. Service workers, on the other hand, are specifically designed to enhance web application functionality by providing offline support, caching, and push notifications. They are essential for building Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and ensuring a better user experience, especially in scenarios with unreliable network connections.

```js
//factorial-worker.js (the web worker script):
// Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number
function calculateFactorial(number) {
  if (number === 0 || number === 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  return number * calculateFactorial(number - 1);
}

// Listen for messages from the main thread
self.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
  const number = event.data;

  // Calculate the factorial
  const result = calculateFactorial(number);

  // Send the result back to the main thread
  self.postMessage(result);
});
