    Hyper text Markup language

    Tags -its an annotation for content in html
    example : <p>hello!</p>

    Empty tags(self closing): the tags that dont have closing tag . 
    like:<hr> or u could also use <hr/>

    Attriutes: Attributes are a way for us to pass extra data to tags that will change
    the browser behaviour for that tag.
    ex: <input type="checkbox"/>

    <!DOCTYPE html></html>
    -Its used to tell to use html5 to browsser

    Semantic html:HTML loses its semantic meaning when tags are misused,or generic
    tags like <div> or <span>
    Semantic HTML includes the usage of semantic grouping of tags which give meaning to different
    sections of the page

    <article>-self contained independly distributable
    <section>-thematic grouping of content
    <header>-introductory content
    <main>-main content
    <nav>-A section of links, often times for the primary navigation of page
    <aside>-Non vital content outside of main content
    <footer>-footer of page

Accessibility -Building Applications that are usable for as many people as possible

Accessibility tree: A tree representation of the page focusing on information specific to accessibilty
                    .Each node in this tree contains information such as the role,state,name and description

HTML ->      DOM        -> UI ->USER
              |                   /\
              \/                   |
    ACESSIBILITY-TREE->ASSISTIVE TECH.

Writing accessible HTML:
*Use descriptive content,labels,alt & attributes
*Use Semantic HTML
*Test keyboard controls

WAI-ARIA: it is a accessibility specification developed W3C.
It means WEB ACCESSBILITY INITIATIVE -ACCESSIBLE RICH INTERNET APPLICATIONS
It consists of:
*Roles: What an element does
        -Landmark Roles -ex: banner,main,navigation
        -Structure Roles-ex:tootip,list,table
        -Widget roles:Interactive elements ex:tav,searchbox,button

*Properties:Extra meaning (ie label)
*states:current state (ie disabled)
--->

<div role="dialog" aria-labelledby="title">
  <h1 id="title">Dialog Heading</h1>
  <p>
    The aria role and label don't change the output at all visually, but this
    dialog is more accessible now!
  </p>
</div>
