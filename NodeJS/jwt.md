JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are an RFC 7519 open industry standard for representing claims between two parties.
For example, you can use jwt.io to decode, verify, and produce JWT.

JWT specifies a compact and self-contained method for communicating information as a JSON object between two parties. Because it is signed, this information can be checked and trusted. JWTs can be signed using a secret (using the HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code )algorithm) or an RSA or ECDSA public/private key combination. In a moment, weâ€™ll see some examples of how to use them.
