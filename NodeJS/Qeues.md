In an event-driven programming environment like Node.js, the event loop manages different types of queues to handle various types of events and tasks efficiently. Here are the main types of queues in the event loop:

1. **Callback Queue (Task Queue):**

   - The callback queue, often referred to as the task queue, is where callback functions (also known as event handlers or completion callbacks) are placed after asynchronous operations are completed. These operations include I/O operations, timers, and other non-blocking tasks.
   - Callbacks in this queue are executed in the order they were added and processed one at a time, ensuring that they don't block the event loop.
   - Example: Callbacks from `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, file system operations, network requests, and other asynchronous functions are queued here.

2. **Microtask Queue (Job Queue):**

   - The microtask queue, also known as the job queue or microtask queue, holds smaller, high-priority tasks that are executed immediately after the currently executing code is completed but before the next event loop cycle begins.
   - Microtasks are typically used for tasks that need to execute as soon as possible, such as promises and certain parts of the JavaScript specification.
   - Microtasks are processed in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) order, ensuring that they are executed immediately after the current execution context is cleared.
   - Example: Promises and `process.nextTick` callbacks are queued here.

3. **Timer Queue (Timeout Queue):**

   - The timer queue holds callbacks scheduled to run after a specified time interval using `setTimeout` and `setInterval`.
   - These callbacks are organized in the order of their scheduled execution times. The event loop periodically checks this queue to determine which timers are ready to be executed and moves them to the callback queue when their time expires.
   - Example: Callbacks scheduled with `setTimeout` and `setInterval` are placed in this queue.

4. **I/O Queue (Poll Queue):**

   - The I/O queue, also known as the poll queue or event queue, contains callbacks related to I/O operations, such as reading from or writing to files or handling network requests.
   - The event loop checks this queue for events that are ready to be processed and moves them to the callback queue for execution.
   - Example: Callbacks associated with reading files or handling network events are queued here.

5. **Check Queue (Immediate Queue):**
   - The check queue, also known as the immediate queue, holds callbacks scheduled to execute at the end of the current event loop iteration.
   - These callbacks are executed after all the callbacks in the current event loop iteration have been processed.
   - Example: Callbacks scheduled with `setImmediate` are placed in this queue.

It's important to note that the event loop in Node.js follows a specific order when processing these queues, and it continues to loop indefinitely, handling events and callbacks as they become available. Understanding the behavior of these queues is crucial for writing efficient and non-blocking Node.js applications.
