/*
A module is an encapsulated chunk of code that has its own context

In node each file is treated as a separated module
1.Local Modules: 
    Modules that we create in our application
    To load a module into another file ,we use the require function 
    Before a modules code is executed nodejs will wrap  it
    with function wrapper that provides module scope
    This saves us from conflicting variables and functions 

2.Built-in modules : 
    Modules that node.js ships with out of the box

    3.Third party Modules- 
    Modules written by other developers that we can use in
