Here are a few design patterns in JavaScript:

1. **Singleton Pattern**: This pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is useful when you need to limit the number of instances of a resource-intensive object.

2. **Factory Pattern**: This pattern provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is useful when you need to create objects dynamically based on user input or other factors.

3. **Module Pattern**: This pattern allows you to create private and public methods and variables in JavaScript, helping to prevent naming collisions and improve code organization.

4. **Observer Pattern**: This pattern allows an object to notify other objects when its state changes. This pattern is useful when you need to maintain consistency between related objects without tightly coupling them.

5. **Prototype Pattern**: This pattern creates new objects based on an existing object, which can help reduce the number of objects created and improve performance.

6. **Pub/Sub Pattern**: This pattern provides a way for multiple objects to communicate with each other without being tightly coupled. The publisher object broadcasts messages to subscribers, who receive the messages and take appropriate action.

These design patterns are just a few of the many that can be used in JavaScript. Each pattern has its own strengths and weaknesses and should be used in the appropriate context to ensure code that is maintainable, efficient, and scalable.
